# ADR-008: Prometheus and Grafana for Observability

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a comprehensive observability solution that provides metrics collection, visualization, alerting, and monitoring across all microservices. The solution should be open-source, scalable, and provide rich insights into system performance and health.

## Decision
We will use Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization and alerting, complemented by Jaeger for distributed tracing:

- **Prometheus**: Time-series database for metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Visualization and alerting platform
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing for request flow analysis
- **Spring Boot Actuator**: Application metrics and health checks
- **Micrometer**: Metrics facade for Spring Boot applications

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Complete visibility into system performance
- **Open Source**: No licensing costs, full control over data
- **Scalability**: Can handle high-volume metrics collection
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive integration with other tools
- **Technology Showcase**: Demonstrates modern observability practices
- **Alerting**: Proactive monitoring with customizable alerts

### Negative
- **Operational Complexity**: Requires expertise to configure and maintain
- **Storage Requirements**: Time-series data can grow large
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand Prometheus query language
- **Resource Usage**: Monitoring infrastructure requires additional resources

## Alternatives Considered

1. **ELK Stack**: Good for logging but less suitable for metrics
2. **Datadog**: Comprehensive but expensive for portfolio projects
3. **New Relic**: Good APM but proprietary and expensive
4. **CloudWatch**: AWS-specific, limits portability

## Implementation Details

### Prometheus Configuration
- **Scrape Configuration**: Collect metrics from all services
- **Service Discovery**: Automatically discover new services
- **Retention Policy**: Configure data retention periods
- **Alert Rules**: Define alerting conditions
- **Recording Rules**: Pre-compute frequently used metrics

### Metrics Collection
- **Application Metrics**: Business metrics (orders, users, etc.)
- **System Metrics**: JVM, CPU, memory, disk usage
- **HTTP Metrics**: Request rates, response times, error rates
- **Database Metrics**: Connection pools, query performance
- **Custom Metrics**: Domain-specific business metrics

### Grafana Dashboards
- **System Overview**: Overall system health and performance
- **Service Dashboards**: Individual service metrics
- **Business Metrics**: Orders, revenue, user activity
- **Infrastructure**: Database, message queue, cache performance
- **Error Tracking**: Error rates and types across services

### Alerting Configuration
- **High Error Rate**: Alert when error rate exceeds threshold
- **High Response Time**: Alert when response times are slow
- **Service Down**: Alert when services are unavailable
- **Resource Usage**: Alert when resources are running low
- **Business Metrics**: Alert on unusual business activity

### Distributed Tracing with Jaeger
- **Request Tracing**: Track requests across service boundaries
- **Performance Analysis**: Identify bottlenecks in request flow
- **Error Investigation**: Trace failed requests to root cause
- **Dependency Mapping**: Visualize service dependencies

### Spring Boot Integration
- **Actuator Endpoints**: Expose health and metrics endpoints
- **Micrometer Registry**: Configure Prometheus registry
- **Custom Metrics**: Define business-specific metrics
- **Health Indicators**: Custom health checks for dependencies

### Monitoring Best Practices
- **Golden Signals**: Monitor latency, traffic, errors, saturation
- **SLA Monitoring**: Track service level agreements
- **Capacity Planning**: Monitor resource usage trends
- **Incident Response**: Quick access to relevant metrics during incidents

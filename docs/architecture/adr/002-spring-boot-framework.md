# ADR-002: Spring Boot as Primary Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose a primary framework for building microservices that provides comprehensive support for enterprise patterns, has excellent ecosystem integration, and demonstrates modern Java development practices.

## Decision
We will use Spring Boot [SPRING_BOOT_VERSION] as the primary framework for all microservices with the following Spring ecosystem components:

- **Spring Boot**: Core application framework
- **Spring Cloud**: Microservices patterns and tools
- **Spring Data**: Data access abstraction
- **Spring Security**: Security and authentication
- **Spring Cloud Stream**: Event streaming capabilities
- **Spring Boot Actuator**: Health checks and monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Seamless integration with Spring Cloud components
- **Developer Productivity**: Auto-configuration and convention-over-configuration
- **Enterprise Features**: Built-in support for security, monitoring, and testing
- **Community Support**: Large community and extensive documentation
- **Technology Showcase**: Demonstrates expertise in Spring ecosystem
- **Microservices Ready**: Native support for microservices patterns

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Spring ecosystem can be complex for new developers
- **Memory Footprint**: JVM-based services have higher memory usage
- **Startup Time**: JVM startup time compared to native alternatives

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Quarkus**: Faster startup and lower memory usage, but smaller ecosystem
2. **Micronaut**: Good performance, but less mature microservices support
3. **Node.js/Express**: Different technology stack, but would limit Java expertise demonstration

## Implementation Details

### Spring Boot Features Used
- **Auto-configuration**: Automatic bean configuration based on classpath
- **Externalized Configuration**: Environment-specific configuration
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health indicators
- **Metrics**: Micrometer integration for metrics collection
- **Profiles**: Environment-specific profiles (dev, test, prod)

### Spring Cloud Components
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**: API gateway implementation
- **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka**: Service discovery
- **Spring Cloud Config**: Centralized configuration
- **Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker**: Resilience4j integration
- **Spring Cloud Sleuth**: Distributed tracing

### Spring Data Integration
- **Spring Data JPA**: For PostgreSQL-based services
- **Spring Data MongoDB**: For MongoDB-based services
- **Spring Data Redis**: For Redis caching
- **Spring Data Elasticsearch**: For search functionality

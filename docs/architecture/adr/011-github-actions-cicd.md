# ADR-011: GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Status
Accepted

## Context
A robust CI/CD pipeline is required to automate build, test, and deployment processes for all microservices. The solution should be cloud-native, easy to integrate with GitHub repositories, cost-effective for open source/portfolio projects, and support a wide range of build/test tools.

## Decision
We will use **GitHub Actions** as the primary CI/CD tool for this project.

- **Integration**: Native integration with GitHub repositories
- **Automation**: Automate build, test, and deployment workflows
- **Cost**: Free for public repositories and generous free tier for private repos
- **Ecosystem**: Large marketplace of reusable actions
- **Flexibility**: Supports matrix builds, secrets, and environment variables
- **Cloud-Native**: No self-hosted infrastructure required

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Easy Setup**: Simple YAML-based workflow configuration
- **Scalable**: Cloud-hosted runners scale automatically
- **Visibility**: Integrated status checks and logs in GitHub UI
- **Community Support**: Large ecosystem and documentation
- **Cost-Effective**: No additional cost for public repos

### Negative
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Tied to GitHub ecosystem
- **Limited Customization**: Less control than self-hosted solutions
- **Resource Limits**: Free tier has usage limits for private repos
- **Secrets Management**: Must be managed via GitHub UI

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Jenkins**: Popular and flexible, but requires self-hosting and maintenance
2. **GitLab CI**: Good integration with GitLab, but not native to GitHub
3. **CircleCI/Travis CI**: Good cloud options, but less integrated with GitHub and may have cost/feature tradeoffs

## Implementation Details

- **Workflow Files**: Store YAML workflow files in `.github/workflows/`
- **Build & Test**: Use matrix builds to test across multiple Java versions and OSes
- **Docker Integration**: Build and push Docker images as part of the pipeline
- **Deployment**: Automate deployment to Kubernetes or other environments
- **Secrets**: Store sensitive data in GitHub repository secrets
- **Status Checks**: Enforce required checks before merging PRs
- **Notifications**: Use GitHub Actions for Slack/email notifications if needed

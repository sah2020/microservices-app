# ADR-007: Multi-Database Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
In a microservices architecture, each service should own its data and choose the most appropriate database technology for its specific requirements. We need to demonstrate different database technologies and patterns while maintaining data consistency across services.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-database strategy where each service uses the most appropriate database technology for its domain:

- **PostgreSQL**: For services requiring ACID transactions and complex relationships
- **MongoDB**: For services requiring flexible schemas and document storage
- **Redis**: For caching and session management
- **Elasticsearch**: For search and analytics
- **Event Store**: PostgreSQL for event sourcing

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Technology Diversity**: Demonstrates expertise in multiple database technologies
- **Optimized Performance**: Each service uses the best database for its needs
- **Scalability**: Different databases can be scaled independently
- **Flexibility**: Services can evolve their data models independently
- **Learning Opportunity**: Team gains experience with multiple technologies

### Negative
- **Operational Complexity**: Managing multiple database technologies
- **Data Consistency**: Challenges in maintaining consistency across services
- **Transaction Management**: No distributed transactions across databases
- **Backup and Recovery**: Different strategies for different databases

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Database**: Simpler but doesn't demonstrate technology diversity
2. **Database per Service with Same Technology**: Less complex but limited learning
3. **Polyglot Persistence**: More complex but maximum technology diversity

## Implementation Details

### Database Assignments

#### PostgreSQL Services
- **User Service**: User accounts, profiles, preferences
- **Order Service**: Orders, order items, order history (event store)
- **Payment Service**: Payment transactions, refunds
- **Analytics Service**: Business intelligence data

#### MongoDB Services
- **Inventory Service**: Product catalog, inventory levels
- **Notification Service**: Notification history, templates

#### Redis
- **Session Management**: User sessions across services
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting
- **Distributed Locks**: Coordination between services

#### Elasticsearch
- **Product Search**: Full-text search for products
- **Order Search**: Search orders by various criteria
- **Analytics**: Real-time analytics and reporting

### Data Migration Strategies
- **Flyway**: For PostgreSQL schema migrations
- **Mongock**: For MongoDB schema migrations
- **Event Sourcing**: For order service data evolution

### Data Consistency Patterns
- **Eventual Consistency**: Accept temporary inconsistencies
- **SAGA Pattern**: Maintain consistency through compensation
- **Event Sourcing**: Rebuild state from events
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models

### Backup and Recovery
- **PostgreSQL**: Point-in-time recovery with WAL
- **MongoDB**: Replica sets with oplog
- **Redis**: RDB and AOF persistence
- **Elasticsearch**: Snapshot and restore

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Database Metrics**: Monitor performance and health
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connections
- **Query Performance**: Monitor slow queries
- **Data Growth**: Track storage usage and growth

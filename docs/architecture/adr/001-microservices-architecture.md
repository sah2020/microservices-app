# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture Pattern

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to build a comprehensive e-commerce system that demonstrates modern software architecture patterns and technologies for portfolio purposes. The system should be scalable, maintainable, and showcase various microservices patterns and technologies.

## Decision
We will implement a microservices architecture with the following characteristics:

- **Service Decomposition**: Break down the e-commerce domain into bounded contexts
- **Independent Deployment**: Each service can be deployed independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Use different technologies and patterns across services
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Implement both synchronous and asynchronous communication
- **Distributed Data Management**: Each service owns its data with separate databases

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Technology Showcase**: Demonstrates expertise in multiple technologies and patterns
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled based on demand
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system
- **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can work on different services independently
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use the most appropriate technology stack

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Increased operational complexity with multiple services
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication adds latency
- **Data Consistency**: Distributed data management requires careful coordination
- **Testing Complexity**: Integration testing becomes more complex
- **Deployment Complexity**: Multiple services need to be deployed and managed

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic Architecture**: Simpler to develop and deploy, but doesn't showcase microservices expertise
2. **Service Mesh**: Would add complexity without significant benefits for this portfolio project
3. **Serverless Architecture**: Would limit technology diversity and learning opportunities

## Implementation Details

### Service Boundaries
- **User Management**: User registration, authentication, profile management
- **Order Management**: Order creation, processing, status tracking
- **Inventory Management**: Product catalog, stock management
- **Payment Processing**: Payment transactions and processing
- **Notification Service**: Email and SMS notifications
- **Analytics Service**: Business intelligence and reporting

### Communication Patterns
- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for direct service-to-service communication
- **Asynchronous**: Event-driven communication using Kafka and RabbitMQ
- **API Gateway**: Centralized entry point for external clients

### Data Management
- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data
- **Event Sourcing**: For order service to demonstrate modern data patterns
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models for order service

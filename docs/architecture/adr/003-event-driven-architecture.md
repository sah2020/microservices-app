# ADR-003: Event-Driven Architecture with Kafka

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to implement asynchronous communication between microservices to demonstrate event-driven patterns, decouple services, and handle high-throughput scenarios like notifications and order processing.

## Decision
We will implement an event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka as the primary event streaming platform with the following patterns:

- **Event Streaming**: Kafka for high-throughput event processing
- **Event Sourcing**: Store all domain events for audit and replay
- **CQRS**: Separate command and query models
- **SAGA Pattern**: Distributed transactions using events
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Handle failed event processing

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate through events without direct dependencies
- **Scalability**: Kafka provides high throughput and horizontal scaling
- **Fault Tolerance**: Events can be replayed and processed asynchronously
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all domain events
- **Technology Showcase**: Demonstrates modern event-driven patterns
- **Real-time Processing**: Enables real-time analytics and notifications

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Event-driven systems are more complex to design and debug
- **Eventual Consistency**: Data consistency challenges across services
- **Event Schema Evolution**: Managing schema changes across services
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Tracing issues across event streams

## Alternatives Considered

1. **RabbitMQ**: Simpler message queuing, but less suitable for event streaming
2. **Apache Pulsar**: Alternative streaming platform, but smaller community
3. **Synchronous REST**: Simpler but creates tight coupling between services

## Implementation Details

### Kafka Configuration
- **Topics**: Domain-specific topics for each bounded context
- **Partitions**: Configured for parallel processing
- **Replication**: Multi-broker setup for fault tolerance
- **Schema Registry**: For event schema management and evolution

### Event Patterns
- **Domain Events**: Business events that occurred in the domain
- **Integration Events**: Events for cross-service communication
- **Event Versioning**: Schema evolution strategies
- **Event Correlation**: Track related events across services

### Services Using Kafka
- **Order Service**: Publishes order events (created, updated, completed)
- **Inventory Service**: Consumes order events, publishes inventory events
- **Payment Service**: Consumes order events, publishes payment events
- **Notification Service**: Consumes various events for notifications
- **Analytics Service**: Consumes events for business intelligence

### Event Processing
- **Kafka Streams**: Real-time event processing and aggregation
- **Spring Cloud Stream**: Event processing abstractions
- **Error Handling**: Dead letter queues for failed events
- **Monitoring**: Kafka metrics and consumer lag monitoring
